# Who am I?

### Tim Soethout
- Functional programmer at heart
- Scala evangelist/trainer inside ING
- More recently: Aquarium enthusiast &amp; West Coast Swing-dancer


Note:
- Come from Functional programming with Haskell. Now Scala!
- If you know Scala/Haskell-like features, it's horrible to need to use Java again, amirite?
- Enable people to do Scala within ING
- Aquarium, see the picture
- WCS, new lessons are starting soon ;)

# Scala @ ING
![ING](lib/image/ING_logo.png)
  </section>

	<section data-markdown>
## State (2015)

- Much Java with Maven
- Some Scala for restful services using Akka
- Open source: Coral
- Developers are getting interested and looking for possibilities

Note:
- Coral is a realtime analytics framework build on Akka and Spark presented by Natalino Busa at an earlier meetup
  </section>

	<section data-markdown>
## Context

- Maven project written in Java 6
- Team with mixed Scala experience levels
  - Eager to do Scala
  - But within Enterprise: Compliancy

Note:
- Enterprise and thus code quality, maintainability and other compliancy
- This was already in place for Java, but for Scala not yet
- To do this right, we needed some tools
- Tooling in place for Java, Scala tooling needs to get on par
- Let's see what we did
  </section>

# Compiling Scala in Maven
  </section>

	<section data-markdown>
## [scala-maven-plugin](http://davidb.github.io/scala-maven-plugin/usage.html)

```xml
&lt;project&gt;
  &lt;build&gt;
    &lt;sourceDirectory&gt;src/main/scala&lt;/sourceDirectory&gt;
    &lt;testSourceDirectory&gt;src/test/scala&lt;/testSourceDirectory&gt;
    &lt;plugins&gt;
      &lt;plugin&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;net.alchim31.maven&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;scala-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;3.2.2&lt;/version&gt;
        ...
      &lt;/plugin&gt;
    &lt;/plugins&gt;
  &lt;/build&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
```

Note:
- Most common way
- Works for most usecases, but you run into trouble when mixing sources
- Show this in next section

# Mixing Java and Scala source
  </section>

	<section data-markdown>
## Demo
### Mixed Java &amp; Scala

Note:
- Show
	+ Source files for Java &amp; Scala
	+ Testcases - `@RunWith(classOf[JUnitRunner])`
	+ IntelliJ test
	+ `mvn test`
	</section>

  <section data-markdown>
## Demo
### Multiple modules

Note:
- Show
	+ Change branch to `multimodule`
	+ Parent pom
	+ individual poms
- Do `HelloWorld2.java`
	+ add dependency from `module2` on `module1`
	+ add `new module1.HelloWorld().hello()`
	+ add `new module1.HelloScala().test()`
	+ All works flawlessly because of module1 being compiled to `/target/` correctly
- Same for Scala to Java `HelloScala2.scala`
  + def test = new module1.HelloWorld().hello()
  + def someOther = new module1.HelloScala().test
- Now try inside module1: `HelloWorld.java`
  + `public String hello() { return new HelloScala().test();}
	+ Fails because `maven-compiler-plugin` can't find Scala sources
	+ Disabling `maven-compiler-plugin` solves the first part
	+ Also need incremental compilation turned on to find
	</section>

  <section data-markdown>
## Mixing it up

- Seems to work on first sight
- Problems can arise in:
  + (Multiple modules - fixed with scala-maven-plugin)
  + Dependencies from Java to Scala
    - Depends on compile order
    - sbt incremental compiler to the rescue

scala-maven-plugin:
```xml
&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;recompileMode&gt;incremental&lt;/recompileMode&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
```

Note:
- Know how to solve these problems to counter naysayers
- TODO: Maybe weird to mention this here? Example about java/scala incompatibility should go to single module part?
	</section>

  <section data-markdown>
## [sbt-compiler-maven-plugin](https://code.google.com/p/sbt-compiler-maven-plugin/)

- Another option; runs sbt underneath
- Not really maintained anymore, but helped us a lot 6 months ago

```xml
&lt;plugin&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.code.sbt-compiler-maven-plugin&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;sbt-compiler-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.0.0-beta5&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;executions&gt;
        &lt;execution&gt;
            &lt;goals&gt;
                &lt;goal&gt;compile&lt;/goal&gt;
                &lt;goal&gt;testCompile&lt;/goal&gt;
                &lt;goal&gt;addScalaSources&lt;/goal&gt;
            &lt;/goals&gt;
            &lt;id&gt;default-sbt-compile&lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;/execution&gt;
    &lt;/executions&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
```

Note:
- Try this is scala-maven-plugin does not work
- `&lt;recompileMode&gt;incremental&lt;/recompileMode&gt;` seems the way to go now

# Code coverage
  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
## Cobertura, Jacoco, Clover, EclEmma?!?

- Works good for Java
- Line and branch coverage

Note:
- Cobertura instruments byte code offline
- Jacoco agent for on-the-fly bytecode instrumentation
  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
## Demo
### Let's try it for Scala!

Note:
- (branch `code-coverage`)
- `mvn clean cobertura:cobertura`
- Make everything big for viewers
- Try Jacoco
- `open module1/target/site/jacoco/index.html` - see bad coverage for Scala...

  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
## That's awful!

- Scala compiler generates lots for you (i.e. in case classes, traits etc)
  + Cobertura and Jacoco work on byte code
  + ergo lots of uncovered generated code
	+ I don't want to be testing generated code, would you?

Note:
- For us this meant code coverage statistic become nearly useless, since you can't see the difference between low coverage or tool screwups
- This is partly solvable by using [`jacoco-scala-maven-plugin`](http://timezra.blogspot.nl/2013/10/jacoco-and-scala.html), which filters the results
- Since Jacoco instruments on the fly, it sometimes has weird behaviour in Java coverage as well. We wanted 95%+ coverage, so every false negatives made our lives much harder.
  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
## [scoverage-maven-plugin](https://github.com/scoverage/scoverage-maven-plugin) to the rescue!

- Scala statement and branch coverage!

Note:
- Statement coverage means granularity on coverage is not limited by full lines!
- Much better fit for Scala

  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
## Demo
### Let's try it for Scala!

Note:
- branch `code-coverage-scoverage`
- `mvn scoverage:report`
- But case class not covered... Well that is ok, since it is all generated code, which should just work(tm)
- Optional: `new HelloScala().notCovered();` in Java test file - cover scala code from Java test case
- Hmmm... no Java Coverage...

  </section>

	<section data-markdown>
## So what did we do?!

- Statement coverage for Scala with scoverage
- Normal line/branch coverage for Java with Cobertura

Note:
- Best of both worlds
- Next chapter on correct overall coverage numbers

	</section>
</section>

<section>
	<section data-markdown>
# Code quality using Sonar
  </section>

	<section data-markdown>
## [SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org)
- Code Quality Platform
- Code metrics
  + Coverage
  + Complexity
  + Size
  + Rules
- Spot regression

Note:
- Basic website with database with code statistics
- Update on build - locally and build server
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
## Tooling
- [scala-sonarqube-docker](https://github.com/TimSoethout/scala-sonarqube-docker)
  + `docker-compose` script with data container, Postgres database and SonarQube
  + Contains plugins needed for Scala! (Cobertura, scoverage, Java, etc)
- [sonar-scala-plugin](https://github.com/TimSoethout/sonar-scala/releases) - updated to use cobertura only for Java
- [`xml-transform-maven-plugin`](https://github.com/TimSoethout/transform-xml-maven-plugin)
  + Used for filtering Scala coverage from `cobertura.xml`

Note:
- docker-compose is a way to easily define groups of docker containers that should work together
- Show plugins installed in Sonar: http://172.16.164.130:9000/updatecenter
  + scalastyle checks code style/quality
  + checkstyle for java+
  + ...
  + Scala plugin - patched version enabling Java/Scala mixing
- There are xslt-transformation plugins available, but they require xslt file in resources on every project
- Explain use for transformation plugin next slide
	</section>

	<section>
<h2>Demo</h2>
<h3>Java &amp; Scala code coverage in Sonar</h3>


<img src="lib/image/sonar-build.dot.svg" class="stretch">

<aside class="notes">
		Explain:
		<ul>
			<li> Java and scala source is measured during testing. (By 2 maven plugins)
			<li> Cobertura collects coverage on both Java/Scala, because instruments bytecode
			<li> Sonar can't handle multiple results from 2 sources, which would be the case for scala sources
			<li> cobertura.xml has easy way to filter files by removing nodes with *.java in an attribute
			<li> I wrote xml-transform-maven-plugin to do easy xpath deletions on files as part of the build
		</ul>
		Show:
		<ul>
			<li> Sonar settings
			<li> cobertura-maven-plugin
			<li> xml-transform-maven-plugin config (verify)
			<li> `mvn clean cobertura:cobertura scoverage:report verify sonar:sonar`
			<li> sonar output (via coverage) - also scalastylestyle

## Compiler flags Java

- `-Xlint:unchecked` - Unchecked casts

Note:
- TODO lookup comments on these
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
## Compiler flags Scala

- `-unchecked`
- `-deprecation`
- `-feature`
- `-Xlint`
- `-Yno-adapted-args`
- `-Ywarn-dead-code`
- `-Ywarn-numeric-widen`
- `-Ywarn-value-discard`
- `-Xfuture`
- `-Ywarn-unused-import`
- `-Ywarn-unused`

Note:
- gives warnings
- `-unchecked` - checks unchecked casts and erasure!
- `-deprecation` - warn deprecated APIs
- `-feature` - explicitly enable advanced features: dynamics, higher kinds, existential types etc
- `-Xlint` - Enable recommended additional warnings
- `-Yno-adapted-args` - repl: `List(1,2,3).toSet()` - returns false, wtf?! - `scala -Yno-adapted-args`
- `-Ywarn-dead-code` - warns about dead code
- `-Ywarn-numeric-widen` - Warn when numerics are widened. Can happen when implicits are involved
- `-Ywarn-value-discard` - Warn when non-Unit expression results are unused
- `-Xfuture` - make feature behave like next major version, this catches breaking changes early
- `-Ywarn-unused-import` - warns on unused imports
- `-Ywarn-unused` - Warn when local and private vals, vars, defs, and types are are unused
- And much more, check man page for scalac.
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
## Demo
### Compiler flags


Note:
- Show unused import.. add to Scala source file and compile
- TODO add ### FindBugs &amp; FindSecurityBugs
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
## More checks - To implement

- [Abide](https://github.com/scala/scala-abide)
- [Wartremover](https://github.com/puffnfresh/wartremover)

Note:
- As you see I love to be able to depend on tooling to catch my mistakes.
- Wartremover &amp; Abide (Julian Dragos, maintainer will give talk after me): lint tool, which can be used to define rules for your code
- All of them can be added as Scala compiler plugins
